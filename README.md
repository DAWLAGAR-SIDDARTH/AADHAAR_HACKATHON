# UIDAI Aadhaar Hackathon – Data Analysis Project

## Project Title
Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates

## Overview
This project analyses aggregated and anonymised Aadhaar datasets released by UIDAI to identify meaningful trends, geographic disparities, and lifecycle relationships across Aadhaar enrolment, demographic updates, and biometric updates.

The objective is to derive data-driven insights that can support informed administrative decision-making, service planning, and system improvements.

The analysis is organised into modular components to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and interpretability.

## Datasets Used

- Aadhaar Enrolment Dataset  
  Aggregated enrolment data by date, state, district, PIN code, and age group (0–5, 5–17, 18+).

- Aadhaar Demographic Update Dataset  
  Aggregated demographic update data reflecting changes to resident details across geography and time.

- Aadhaar Biometric Update Dataset  
  Aggregated biometric update data by modality (fingerprint, iris, face), geography, and time.

All datasets are aggregated and anonymised.

## Methodology

- Consolidation of multiple periodic files into longitudinal datasets  
- Resolution of duplicate geographic–temporal records through aggregation  
- Minimal and safe preprocessing suitable for aggregated data  
- Trend analysis and ratio-based feature engineering  
- K-Means clustering for geographic segmentation  
- Correlation analysis for cross-dataset lifecycle relationships

## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
  - Data preprocessing and analysis  
  - Feature engineering and clustering  
  - Correlation analysis  

- Power BI  
  - Interactive dashboards  
  - Trend and geographic visualisations

## Key Insights

- Aadhaar enrolment shows long-term growth with periodic fluctuations  
- Demographic and biometric updates are strongly correlated with enrolment activity  
- Aadhaar operates as a continuous lifecycle system rather than a one-time enrolment process  
- A small number of PIN codes act as high-intensity Aadhaar service hubs  
- Update activity highlights regional service demand and infrastructure stress points
